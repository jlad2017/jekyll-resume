    company: Georgia Institute of Technology, Department of Mathematics
    description:  Implemented compressed sensing and machine learning optimization algorithms (e.g. Linearized Bregman, Adam) in Python to compare runtiems and small detail recovery for a 2D signal. Developed a new algorithm drawing on the strengths of multiple different implementations and compared its performance to existing solutions.
